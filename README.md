# Academic Pages
**Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.**

![Academic Pages template example](images/homepage.png "Academic Pages template example")

# Getting Started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

## Running locally

When you are initially working your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
    On MacOS the commands are:
    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    brew install node
    gem install bundler
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

If you are running on Linux it may be necessary to install some additional dependencies prior to being able to run locally: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc make`

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Start by build the container:

```bash
docker build -t jekyll-site .
```

Next, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app jekyll-site
```

# Maintenance

Bug reports and feature requests to the template should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii) and additional maintainers would be welcomed.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch.

# Personal portfolio redesign

The homepage at `/` uses `_layouts/portfolio-home.html`, selected by
`_pages/about.md`. Styling and browser interactions live in `assets/portfolio/`.
It uses the existing GitHub Pages/Jekyll deployment without additional dependencies.
The downloadable CV is `files/NegarHonarvar.pdf`.

The DAGMRNet graph uses eight SVG viewport crops from the author's public
[architecture figure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f8b733-4845-4fbe-b42b-ede9e59f98c4),
preserved unchanged in `assets/portfolio/dagm-architecture.png`. These are image
patches from one example, not separate subjects or a live reconstruction.
`assets/portfolio/graph.js` animates nodes, attached edges, and connection pulses;
it stops offscreen, in hidden tabs, on pause, and with reduced motion enabled.
Ten browser checks passed under both normal and reduced-motion settings,
including real-time movement, pause/resume, and 320/390/1440px sizing.

The Ask AI dialog is explicitly an interface preview. Topic buttons show prepared
answers grounded in the supplied CV and existing biography. Free-form questions
explain that live AI is not connected. No questions are stored or transmitted.
A future live assistant needs a separate server endpoint; API keys must never be
added to this public repository or browser JavaScript.

Certificate entries currently contain text from the CV. Replace or supplement
them with actual degree/certificate scans when provided; no certificate images
have been fabricated. The site continues to use `negarhonarvar.github.io`.

Local verification: JavaScript syntax and whitespace checks passed; headless
Edge checks covered 320px, 390px, and 1440px overflow, local assets, section links,
the CV response, assistant interactions, focus return, and safe text rendering.
Desktop and narrow-screen screenshots were inspected. A full Jekyll build was
not run locally because Ruby/Bundler are unavailable; verify the GitHub Pages
build before merging the redesign branch.
