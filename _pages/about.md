I am a senior Computer Engineering student at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://encse.sbu.ac.ir/). I am currently focusing on the application of Graph Neural Networks for reconstructing undersampled Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images under supervision of Prof. [Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trWxrgcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (Co-advised by Dr. [Shahabedin Nabavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trWxrgcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). My research aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cardiac MRI reconstructions through advanced neural network architectures.

My research interests center on Deep Learning with applications across Robotics, Healthcare, Graph Learning and Computer Vision. I strive to enhance my understanding of these fields by investigating both the foundational mathematics and practical applications underlying advanced algorithms. My goal is to leverage this deeper, theoretical knowledge to develop robust, real-world solutions to complex problems, such as autonomous control for robotics, optimized trading strategies, and predictive healthcare models.
