## [Enhanced Farsi News Classification (Mar. 2024)](https://github.com/negarhonarvar/Enhanced-News-Classification-On-Large-Dataset)

 * The goal of this project is to develop an enhanced neural network model to classify farsi news articles into their respective categories.
 * The dataset has been preprocessed with Tokenization and Feature Extraction.

## [Classic Compture Vision(Feb. 2024)](https://github.com/negarhonarvar/Computer-Vision/blob/main/README.md)

* Application of Classic Computer Vision Techniques such as Filtering , Transformation and Feature Extraction for image interpretation.

## [Guidance of a Quadcopter for Object Detection(Mar. 2024)](https://github.com/negarhonarvar/Guidance-of-a-Quadcopter-for-Object-Detection)

* Designed a controller for a quadcopter to control its flight over boxes in an urban environment, automatically taking precise images of boxes and interpret the images using Computer Vision Deep Learning-Based Approaches.
* After the interpretation of the taken image, the quadcopter should determine whether the item matches the target item or not. In case of matching, the quadcopter will land beside the box and turn its front LED's on.
